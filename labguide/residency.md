<p align="justify"> Open FIESTA (Open Faculty for Innovation, Education, Science, Technology and Art, Tsinghua University) is aiming to build a global hub and a worldwide network to foster next generation research, education, and innovation. As part of the Open FIESTA, our goal is to build and establish a Community Lab.</p>

<br>

**Open FIESTA Community Lab**

<p align="justify"> As an interdisciplinary teaching lab & learning space, we provide a unique place where students experiment, try different ideas and learn in the process. Some of them do it as initial research for a startup, some of them just out of curiosity and a passion to create. Unlike a traditional research lab in universities or companies, in our lab the research goals are set by the makers themselves according to Open Science spirit.  If you have a project you couldn't get support from traditional labs, then come and do it in Open FIESTA. </p>

</br>

**Roadmap - What is the residency program?**

<p align="justify"> We have built the laboratory facilities of our Open FIESTA Community Lab, and now seek to create a community around it. To that end, we have established the residency program which wants to jumpstart the making of this community by inviting cohorts of makers over to Shenzhen to create projects using our lab and as a result spark creativity in the local community. A vital part of the program is the symbiotic relationship we want to build between the residents/makers and the Tsinghua students. </p>

<div style="margin:50px;">

<p align="justify"> Shenzhen is a world-renowned hardware manufacturing hub. To begin with, Huaqiangbei, the world’s largest electronics market is located at Shenzhen, and it has anything for which you might wish. Huaqiangbei and surrounding electronics marketplaces have earned Shenzhen nicknames, such as "China's Silicon Valley" and the "Silicon Valley of Hardware." These markets are coupled to a vast hardware manufacturing infrastructure that has given rise to companies as big as Huawei, Tencent, and Evergrande. Shenzhen is the world’s electronics factory, producing 90% of all electronics. This fact has led to a boom of makerspaces, such as Chaihuo Maker Space, Troublemaker, SEGMaker, and SZOIL. Further proof of the magnitude of this hardware hub is that Shenzhen’s GDP has grown to the third in China, after Beijing and Shanghai, and the eighth in the world. This is why makers can find an environment in Shenzhen where they can truly succeed, to develop their hardware product with the best support available.</p>

<p align="justify"> Shenzhen is a coastal city in South China. It is located on the eastern bank of the Pearl River, neighboring Hong Kong, and is home to the world's third-busiest container port and the fourth-busiest airport on the Chinese mainland. Shenzhen has been fundamental to China’s reform and opening-up policy. The Economist marveled at the "Miracle of Shenzhen,” China’s first Special Economic Zone (SEZ), calling it the biggest success of more than 4,000 SEZs in the world. The city attracts tremendous amounts of investment from both the local and national governments, and also from companies, both national and international. </p>

<img src="/image/unresidency.jpg" style="cursor: zoom-in; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 50px">
<p align="justify">The <b>(Un)Residency</b> concept comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">(Un)Conference</a> spirit. UnConferences are participant-driven gatherings, where the members are involved in the decision-making process of the events agenda. The philosophy behind this organizational model is to avoid the hierarchical aspects of conventional programs creating decentralized bottom-up coordination. </p>

<br>

#### What does this mean?

<br>

We have set up [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bpl-b7kBHLbLTy8gcdyMMjCiNyooin71m9NvW5oJ-_M/edit?usp=sharing) where anyone can propose events and brainstorm ideas around the agenda of the residency program. The feasibility of these changes will be considered by a broad panel composed by the program staff and external advisors. 

<br>

Feel free to contribute to the improvement of this program with all your imagination!

</br>


- The residents have to facilitate **one workshop per month** related to their project. Our main goal for these workshops is that they inspire the local community in Shenzhen.

  

- **Well-described** and understandable **documentation** of the project and results on the **Open FIESTA Github**. This should be composed of a proper description of all the research done by the residents during this period. *The intellectual property of this work will belong to the people who have contributed to the development of the project* (The resident, collaborators...), and will be registered under **Creative Commons Attributions**. 

  

- **Open FIESTA** will be required to be attributed as an **official sponsor of the project** in all of the resident work that will be related to our program.

  

- A **video explaining the project**, its goals, and the results at the end of the residence.

<br>

<br>

### Who we are looking for

---

</br>

**A (Bio) Maker / Hacker / Innovator**

<p align="justify"> We are looking for talented makers around the four corners of the world to come to Shenzhen to start their own project and work to bring it to fruition using our facilities. The areas of interest can range from synthetic biology to open science hardware, STEAM Education, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>

</br>

**Resilient**

<p align="justify"> Coming for the first time to work in China can be a challenge. The opportunities of Shenzhen are limitless, but it is in your hand to be active and seize them. The culture is very different from western ones. We are looking for resilient people who could face unexpected daily challenges and are prepared to adapt as fast as unexpected circumstances require. As the maker collective, we know that this is something which defines it, so we are sure that all the makers who come to the labs will manage to use them better than anyone. </p>

<br>

**An openFIESTA ambassador**

<p align="justify"> As the Open FIESTA program is striving to attract world talents, we expect the candidate to recommend the different programs in openFIESTA to talented students in his/her network with a creative spirit, entrepreneurial capability, and strong social responsibility. </p>

<br>

*Come join us hacking Shenzhen!*
